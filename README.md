# E-Commerce Web Application

A full-stack e-commerce web application built with React, designed to support both **administration** and **customer** operation modes.

The system allows administrators to manage product categories, products, customers, and view sales statistics, while registered customers can browse products, manage their account, place orders, and view their order history.

The project focuses on clean architecture, dynamic UI components, state management, and a real-world e-commerce flow including authentication, authorization, and data persistence.
